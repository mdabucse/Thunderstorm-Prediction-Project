**Abstract of the Innovative project report: **
It addresses the critical need for accurate and timely prediction of adverse weather conditions, specifically focusing on thunderstorms, to enhance airfield operational safety and efficiency. Traditional meteorological forecasting methods often struggle to provide sufficiently precise information for aviation planning. In this study, we propose an innovative approach of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict the occurrence of thunderstorms on airfield operations. The model is trained to recognize patterns and correlations between various meteorological variables (Humidity, Temperature, Wind speed) associated with thunderstorms and (Including air pressure). It aims to contribute to the improvement of aviation safety by providing airfield operators. The developed ML model has the potential to offer advanced warning systems, enabling timely implementation of precautionary measures, such as flight diversions, ground delays, or temporary airfield closures. 
The importance and benefits of the innovative project to the society:
Early prediction allows for proactive safety measures to be implemented, such as rerouting flights, rescheduling landings and takeoffs, and initiating ground operations adjustments. Enhances the efficiency of air traffic control by providing accurate forecasts, minimizing disruptions, and ensuring smoother coordination between airfield operators and aviation authorities. Minimizes financial losses associated with flight delays, cancellations, and potential damage to aircraft due to severe weather conditions, leading to cost savings for both airfield operators and airlines. Access to accurate and timely weather predictions enables pilots to make informed decisions, ensuring the safety of passengers and crew by avoiding areas with severe weather conditions.
